# 🗑️ Garbage Classification using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based image classification system that identifies and classifies garbage into six categories: **Plastic, Glass, Metal, Cardboard, Paper, and Trash**. The goal is to assist in smart waste management and encourage better recycling practices.

## 📌 Features

- Classifies waste images into 6 classes
- Built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Trained on a custom labeled dataset
- Real-time prediction support
- Tested with multiple images
- Deployment-ready structure
